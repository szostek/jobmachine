In main package.json:
-Added "type": "module" so node can use ES6 syntax for consistency with front (i.e. use of import instead of require)..
-Added "start": "nodemon server" script to run nodemon

Use concurrently to spin up both server and front

CORS
    -To get around cors issues, we add: 
        "proxy": "http://localhost:5000" 
    to package.json in Client. This only works in dev, so if server and client are hosted separately, further config is needed

Axios: used for managing HTTP requests

Morgan: HTTP logger middleware
    -Allows for easier viewing of HTTP req/res during dev


MAKE A DIAGRAM:
    -Show relationship between server, router, controllers and front-end function calls
    -Visualize how the routes work to add/update user info and jobs
